Viewing weekly subscription emails from meetup.com or goldstar.com are causing K-9 to stop working. Emails from meetup.com cause the K-9 email to start flashing non stop on my Samsung Note 4. Goldstar.com emails cause the screen to turn white for that email and all subsequently read emails. The only was to fix the problem is to kill and restart K-9. The problem is repeatable every time.
